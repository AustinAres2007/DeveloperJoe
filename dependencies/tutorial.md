# Hello!
I am {0}, a [GPT](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/gpt/) powered AI bot.

GPT is different than ChatGPT. GPT is what powers ChatGPT, and ChatGPT focuses mainly on text generation.

## How to Use
To start a chat with {0}, do `/start`. This is the most basic form of communication, and will pick a model that the owner has set to default. 

You can pick a number of parameters to change the conversation name to represent what your chat is about, change GPT model, or stream your conversation like ChatGPT. All parameters are optional, and defaults will be used if not specified.

You can use `/ask` to reply to a conversation started with `start`. The is 1 required parameters, which is only the message you want to send. You can also override other aspects, like the chat you want to use (If you have multiple) or weather you want to stream {0}'s reply.

\* = *You may only change to set GPT models. The models may have set restrictions set by the operator of the server you are in. For example, GPT 4 may only be used by users with a special role. By default, all models are accessable.*
