This is where libraries for voice support and playback will be located. Do not edit any file names.

**Important for Apple Users**

When you first run the bot with the libraries installed, you will likely get a warning. All you have to do is go to `voice/opus-darwin.dylib` or just `voice/opus-darwin` and open it via the terminal. Apple will give you another warning asking if you are sure, click okay, and nothing will happen. Then restart the bot and everything will be good to go.

All that does is give the system your "permission" and "acknowledgment" that you know the file is foreign (downloaded from the internet) The file is perfectly safe to use. Apple is just cautious.
