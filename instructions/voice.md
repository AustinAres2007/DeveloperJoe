# In-depth Voice Setup

This tutorial will go into how to setup voice. This is covered in the `README.md` file, but here I will cover is more extensively and some trouble-shooting guides.

## Warnings

Using voice and broadcasting the TTS messages does take extra resources. Especially if you plan to use voice recogniton. Please make sure you have sufficient server / computer specs. Best way to find out is to just test privately. Play around with some commands, find what you like and see if it has any problems.

## Compatibility

This bot has been programmed on a macOS laptop (M1 Pro) so macOS support is always coming first, but Linux and Windows has full voice support alongside macOS.

Tested on:

macOS (M1 Pro, macOS Sonoma) *VOICE*
Linux (Virtualisation with M1 Pro ARM, Debian 11) *VOICE* and (Intel i3, Debian 12) *VOICE*
Windows (Intel i3, Windows 10) *VOICE* and (Virtualisation with M1 Pro ARM, Windows 11) *NO VOICE*

## Installation

Go to this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AustinAres2007/developerjoe-downloads/releases) for the voice libraries and download the 3 files for your respective machines. Simply drag and drop them into the "voice" folder.
If you are on Linux, you are done. Congratulations.
