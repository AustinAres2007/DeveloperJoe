# Welcome

This is an indepth document on the DeveloperJoe Engine-- on what it does mainly. This is a bot that is fully configurable and modify-able since this project is FULLY open source including the voice libraries which are not mine. They are developed and belong to their very talanted respective developers, I say this with admiration.

# Objective

This documents and all that reside alongside it serve to educate the end-user. (The person who hosts this bot)
I will walk through each command; talk about what it does, the parameters and other aspects of it. 

Feel free to use this as a manual for discord users as it holds no commands or data that is sensitive to the operating of this bot.

# Warnings

This bot is not meant to be used on a large scale. it is to be used by small communities. There are costs associated with running this bot due to services that will have to be used (Like OpenAIs GPT AI Engine) which can get costly if used on a large scale. Smaller database systems are used to keep CPU usage down.

# Extra Warning

Using this bots voice capabilities will use a lot of data and a lot of resources. Please make sure your host computer can handle the demands.
